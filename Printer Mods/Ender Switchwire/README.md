I recently finished streaming my build series for one of the common Ender 3 to Voron Switchwire conversions. The repository for that conversion can be found here: https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW. During the build I ran into a few things that I wanted to change to make my Ender Switchwire mopre like my actual Switchwire.

To do this I made a few changes and have shared the STL files for those customizations here.


The first simple modifications I made were to the upper idlers. I also had to make some thinner XY Tensioners as I found the originals were too wide and would not fit.

The rest of the modifications were pretty sustatial.  First, I wanted to extend the deck to be close to the same length as the real Switchwire and allow me to attach a display in the same way.

To accomplish this I replaced the existing extensions with a set of longer extensions.

Finally I updated the layout of the electronics bay to make eveything a little more accessable. This required a new mount for theww Raspberry Pi and longer 4040 poweer supply mounts.
